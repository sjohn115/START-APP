Project Name: START-APP
==========================
Our project idea originated from the problem of small companies not being able to afford an Alert System.
Many of the big-time Alert-System companies require a specific minimum amount of people, usually around 500, 
and companies that only have 20 or so employees do not have a reasonable, easy way to get an alert system. So
our Application is designed to help these small businesses feel more secure without having to deal with giant
prices or not being able to enter the market at all for being to small.

Our Application, currently Android based, will have a simple but fast user interface where a person in trouble
can quickly send out a silent emergency message. Then the response server will be able to listen for all incoming
messages and make an appropriate response. For example, say a person with a gun were to enter the building. A person with
our application would be able to, in a few easy touches, send out a detailed enough message to the sever that the police,
SWAT team, or other administrators can respond immediately with enough information to save as many lives as possible. 
Time and information are important aspects between life or death, and we hope our application give faster better
communication between people who are in trouble and people who can help.

Most of the projects work will be done is the source directories of
"Server" and "Android". They will mostly be straight forward in terms
of looking at source code.
